The committee defines messages, document structures, and terminology to support the systems and processes used in the collection, storage, distribution, integration and analysis of such information.  The work of this committee will facilitate the availability of safe and effective therapies by improving the processes and efficiencies associated with regulated clinical research.</p><p><emph role="strong">SCOPE</emph></p><p>The Regulated Products domain currently contains specifications addressing Regulated Product Submission, and Structured Product Labeling.

This topic, in the Regulated Studies domain, was approved as a DSTU following a successful DSTU ballot during HL7 International's January 2010 ballot cycle.</p><p>"Publication of this draft standard for trial use and comment has been approved by Health Level Seven, Inc. (HL7). This draft standard is not an accredited American National Standard. The comment period for use of this draft standard shall end 18 months from the date of publication. Suggestions for revision should be submitted at <loc href="http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/index.cfm">//www.hl7.org/dstucomments/index.cfm.</loc></p><p>Following this 18 month evaluation period, this draft standard, revised as necessary, will be submitted to a normative ballot in preparation for approval by ANSI as an American National Standard. Implementations of this draft standard shall be viable throughout the normative ballot process and for up to six months after publication of the relevant normative standard</p></div3><p>Regulatory authorities receive submissions to address a variety of regulatory issues. The information contained in these submissions is divided into numerous files (paper and electronic). Frequently, files in one submission are related to files in earlier submissions. Because the information is divided into numerous files sent over time, it is often difficult to efficiently process and review the information.</p><p>The goal of the Regulated Product Submission message is to facilitate the processing and the review of submissions. Accordingly, the Regulated Product Submission Refined Message Information Model captures all information required for the efficient processing and review of regulatory submissions.</p><p>Different product types have different table of contents; that is to say, different lists of topics that must be addressed within the submission.  However, the general data layouts of all regulated products are the same. Therefore, the objective of the Regulated Product Submission message is to define one message structure that can be used for all regulated products. It is intended that this message will be used, worldwide, for regulated products, including but not limited to, foods, medical devices, human therapeutics, and veterinary medicine.  It is important to note that the wide range of products that is contemplated leads to providing a generic structure for the actual specification.</p><p>Please note that Regulated Product Submission is similar to the Medical Records Document Topic.  This is based on the fact that both require attention to needs for managing a complex set of documents.</p><p><emph role="strong">Scope</emph></p><p>The scope of the initial release of this standard is to define the message for submitting information to regulatory authorities. This message includes the contents of a regulatory submission and all information needed to process the submission message. This message is flexible enough to be used for regulatory submissions for any regulated product. Subsequent releases of the standard will provide information about the submission (e.g. information currently collected on application forms) in addition to information about the files in the submission.</p><p>Although this message can be used for company-to-company communication, the initial intent of this message is for the communication from industry to regulatory authority.</p><p>The Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Technical Committee invites anyone with additional requirements to submit content proposals for future releases of the standard.

For example, the marketing application for a drug product can generate multiple regulatory decisions. The first decision may support the initial marketing approval of the product for a specific indication. Subsequent regulatory decisions may approve or deny additional indications for the drug product. The application thus contains multiple submissions, each with their own regulatory action. Each of those submissions (e.g., initial marketing application, supplemental marketing application) would generally be comprised of multiple submissions units. </p><p>A submission is made up of one or many submission units.

The combinations of these topic codes are well defined by product types. A single topic code can be used in different context. For example, in human therapeutic products the combination of the topic codes Chemistry, Drug substance, Manufacturer is a valid document context. If Chemistry has a topic code of 35, Drug substance has a topic code of 71, and Manufacturer has a topic code of 140, then the combination of Chemistry, Drug substance, and Manufacturer would have a ContextOfUse code of 35-71-140. In addition, if Drug Product has a topic code of 70, then the combination of Chemistry, Drug Product, and Manufacturer would have a ContextOfUse code of 35-70-140.</p><p>In addition the same ContextOfUse code can be used for multiple products. For example the combination of Chemistry, Drug substance, and Manufacturer would be a valid ContextOfUse code for both Human Therapeutic products as well as Animal Products.</p><p>It is also common that different product types will use different combinations of the same topic code. For example a Medical Device product would have a ContextOfUse code that specifies a Cover Letter. However, a Human Therapeutic product would have a ContextOfUse code that would combine the topic codes of both Administrative and Cover Letter.</p><p><emph role="strong">Model Overview</emph></p><p>As industry moves away from paper submissions, all companies producing regulated products will benefit from having published electronic submission standards. Accordingly, the focus of the initial message allows applicants to submit information electronically. The submitted information is structured as a collection of documents that is organized by report sections.  The actual table of required and optional report sections varies from product to product and is defined by regulatory authorities.</p><p>Submitted documents are assigned to support one or more report sections. Furthermore, multiple documents can be assigned to a single report section. Since the same information can be submitted to support multiple applications, it is imperative that this standard allows the re-use of data between applications. Re-using data is accomplished by using the Uniform Resource Locator scheme (through the reference property of the ED datatype that is assigned to Act.text) in the File Act. The URL scheme allows the file in one application to provide a reference to a document that was submitted in another application.</p><p>A single document can be in multiple report sections of an application and can also be in multiple applications. For this reason, we have defined the ContextOfUse Act which provides the relationship of a document to a report section.  Since a submission unit can contain multiple ContextOfUse, this class can be used to indicates each assignment of a document to a section.  Looking across multiple submissions, it is possible to record a single document's context in multiple applications as needed.</p><p>Since this message is primarily focused on document management, it would seem that the ContextOfUse Act would be the obvious choice to the entry point of this message. However, applicants transmit information to regulatory authorities in the form of submission units containing multiple ContextOfUse. These submission units support the overall application.

Most importantly, however, SPL R5 is the first release to rely on the Common Product Model (CPM) for its product data elements content. </p><p>SPL since release 2 consisted of 3 parts: (1) document data structures, (2) data structures describing the product, and (3) data structures describing the clinical use of the product, and connected through the highlight excerpt. Since this release 4, a fourth part, "Product Instance", was added to support listing of devices and biologics, or of any kind of regulated product where reporting must be done on current manufacturing and distribution activity. Now, for release 5, the product structures (2) and the clinical use structures (3) as well as the product instance (4) structures are all found in the Common Product Model. Thus, the SPL specification itself has become but a remnant, i.e., only the structure document model (1). This testifies to the success of the SPL specification, because these 4 core SPL product models have become the foundation of the HL7 common product model which finds use in a much wider scope far beyond product labeling and listing.</p><p>This specification is accompanied by a <artref ref="file:spl-r5-files.zip" alt="bundle of supporting materials"></artref> including the model interchange files (MIF) and the W3C XML Schema (schema). Due to the fact that SPL R5 uses the CPM CMETs, the schema is now divided up over many more files which include each other.  However, the SPL R5 schemas as they are released in this  <artref ref="file:spl-r5-files.zip" alt="bundle of supporting materials"></artref>, have been tested for backwards compatibility with SPL R4 documents. Therefore, none of the existing SPL R4 documents need to change and remain valid under SPL R5.</p></div3><div3 id=""><head>What is SPL?</head><p>The Structured Product Labeling (SPL) specification is a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics of the content of authorized published information that accompanies any medicine licensed by a medicines licensing authority. These documents are known as "product label," "package insert," "prescribing information," "product information," "medicines information," and under many other names. The precise definition and content of product labeling usually varies depending on the country. (For example, in the U.S., all written, printed, or graphic matter accompanying a medicinal product is called "labeling." For human prescription drugs, the "content of labeling" includes all text tables and figures in the labeling described in 21CFR 201.57.) Implementers of this standard should refer to regulations, definitions and guidances applicable for the realm in which the standard will be used.</p><p>An SPL document is created by an organization that is required by law to submit product information document because it is responsible for the creation or marketing of a product, or any other person or organization compelled by other motives to submit information about products, whether originally created or not. This includes, original manufacturers, repackagers, relabelers, and public agencies or private information publishers that submit product information documents. Recipients of product label documents are any person or organization, including the public at large, or an agent of the public (such as a regulatory authority). The need to create SPL documents is typically governed by legal statutes which set points such as the completion of a new drug application (NDA), the change of product information or annual reports as requiring submission of an SPL document.</p><p>Like most documents, an SPL document has sections and sections contain text (paragraphs, lists, tables); SPL documents can be rendered and published in these standard narrative presentations. At the same time, the SPL specification provides semantic markup that permits extraction of relevant data embedded in the narrative so that it can be used for other purposes. In other words, SPL markup of a product labeling document both preserves the human readability of the content and facilitates machine processing of that content. The document may contain references to media files, such as images, which should accompany the SPL document. However, the wrapping of files is not specified, and guidances to this effect exist by regulatory authorities who accept SPL.</p><p>SPL is structured analogous to HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), which specifies the structure and semantics of "clinical documents" for the purpose of exchange. In earlier releases of SPL the CDA text markup XML schema and its defining text had been copied from the CDA specification. This XML schema is also known as the "narrative block" schema, and included in the SPL XML schema release as NarrativeBlock.xml. This narrative block schema is part of the SPL specification; however, it will no longer be reproduced verbatim but rather will be included into the SPL specification by reference only and only variances between CDA and SPL will be discussed in detail.</p><p>Even though the SPL specification was designed analogous to the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, there are fundamental differences between the two specifications, for example:</p><list role="unordered"><item>CDA documents involve a Patient - SPL documents do not.</item><item>CDA documents involve one or more Providers - SPL documents do not.</item><item>CDA documents involve an Encounter - SPL documents do not.</item><item>The potential for authentication is subtly different for product labeling documents than for CDA documents. While a product labeling document may be authenticated, and may even have a requirement for legal authentication in some realms, this authentication occurs on the officially approved version of the document rather than on each minor revision of the document in the process of finalizing it.</item></list><p>SPL was the first HL7 Structured Documents specification designed analogous to CDA but not as simple constraint of the CDA specification itself. It is anticipated that the next release of CDA will split the material into a common HL7 Structured Documents specification that describes the principles of Documents, Document Participations (author, authenticator etc.), Sections, Narrative Block, etc. and a family of content specifications such as CDA (for patient clinical documents), SPL (for product labels) and other types of documents.</p><p>The purpose of the SPL specification is to facilitate the review, editing, storage, dissemination of, and access to product labeling document content. It is intended to:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Facilitate provision of the content of product labeling both electronically and in a human readable format.  SPL documents can be exchanged across systems without the need for additional transformation steps.</item><item>Improve dissemination of product labeling (both new product labeling and product labeling updates) to users of product labeling. The ability to provide the most up-to-date product labeling in a timely manner is considered to be critical to improving risk management of regulated products.</item><item>Facilitate more efficient evaluation of labeling changes by allowing more effective use of computer technology to compare different versions of labeling on a section by section basis.</item><item>Promote more coordinated data collection throughout the regulatory agency and improve processing, storage and archiving capabilities. Reduce or eliminate redundancies in data collection.</item><item>Improve access to information and enhance the ability to query and report on the content of labeling, allowing better support for specific analyses such as sub-population assessments of differences in products based on gender, race, age, and geographic location.</item><item>Improve interoperability of the regulatory agency's systems with other clinical information systems</item><item>Use standards to improve integration of clinical data</item><item>Enhance patient safety by helping to provide prescribers and consumers with improved access to information needed to make better risk management decisions in a format that will enhance integration with other technical and clinical applications.</item><item>Support retention of legacy product labeling in databases</item></list><p>It is important to note that the SPL specification models the structure and semantics of labeling content <emph role="strong">and not the presentation found in printed labeling!</emph> It standardizes the markup of the required content, specifically the structure and semantics of that content. Although the human readability requirement specifies that the content must at the very least be readable using a generic stylesheet that applies to all HL7 structured documents, the use of specialized stylesheets for specific presentation purposes is not prohibited. Limited support for the presentation of content is provided in CDA "narrative block" and has been adopted by SPL.</p><p>The SPL specification does not currently specify the creation or management of documents, only their storage and exchange markup. Document management is critically interdependent with the product labeling specification, but the specification of document management messages is outside the present scope of the SPL specification.</p><p>This specification does not address the transfer mechanism for product labeling documents. The specification for messages that might carry the product labeling document is outside the scope of the SPL specification, although the CDA standard does specify how to package clinical documents within HL7 messages. An SPL document may be transmitted in an HL7 message that is designed to transfer clinical documents. Alternatively, several other mechanisms may be used to transfer product labeling including physical media, PDF, electronic transfer of word processing applications, among many others.</p><div4 id=""><head>XML Markup of SPL Documents</head><p>The SPL specification is a part of HL7 v3 specifications and follows its methodology. According to this methodology, XML Implementation Specification is governed by the rules of the XML Implementation Technology Specification (ITS) and SPL makes no exceptions to this. The XML ITS makes clear that a W3C XML-Schema is provided as informative and useful tool to implementers, but the W3C XML-Schema neither completely defines SPL nor is it an exclusive representative of the XML ITS. Hence, the SPL Schema itself is not normative.</p><p>There are no deviations in the XML Schema which is generated from the SPL Hierarchical Description (HD). However, it may be noted that the ordering of elements in the HD deviates from the standard ordering of elements in other HL7 v3 HDs. This is done for backwards compatibility as the order of these elements does matter to most XML technology.</p></div4><div4 id=""><head>SPL and other HL7 Domains</head><p>SPL is maintained as a project of the Regulated Clinical Research Information Management (RCRIM) committee and issued within the Regulated Products domain. However, SPL maintains ties with other work groups and domains to insure interoperability of information content. This includes the Pharmacy Work Group maintaining the Medication and Pharmacy Domains, and the Patient Safety Work group, maintaining the Individual Case Safety Reporting (ICSR) specifications. These Work Groups have recently (Spring 2008) formed a project to integrate their domain models into a Common Product Model. This Common Product Model has been created based on SPL and the other models in such a way that the SPL model should be preserved as a subset of the Common Product Model. It is anticipated that in the next release of SPL, the SPL model will make normative reference to the Common Product Model rather than copy its contents. But this is subject to the ability of the tooling to allow for the customization of the ordering of elements in the final HDs.</p></div4><div4 id=""><head>Security, Confidentiality, and Data Integrity</head><p>Strong security, confidentiality and data integrity mechanism are currently out of scope of this specification. Implementers will have to comply with applicable law, regulations and guidances.</p></div4><div4 id=""><head>SPL Extensibility</head><p>Extensibility of SPL follows all the same rules and guidelines as extensibility of any other HL7 v3 specification. See the applicable extensibility and conformance specifications.</p></div4><div4 id=""><head>SPL Context Inheritance</head><p>SPL context inheritance is managed in exactly the same way as context inheritance in all other HL7 v3 specifications. This includes contextControlCode for Participations; contextConductionInd (context conduction indicator) for ActRelationships. Most of these attributes have fixed values assigned. In SPL these assignments have been made to the effect that the author-Participation inherits from the Document to all nested Sections unless overridden. Confidentiality and human language codes are also considered part of this context. Because this context always propagates unless overridden, the representation of unknown context is achieved by overriding with a null value.</p></div4></div3><div3 id=""><head>SPL Conformance (NORMATIVE)</head><p>A conformant SPL document is one that at a minimum validates against the SPL Schema, and that restricts its use of coded vocabulary to values allowable within the specified vocabulary domains. However a computer cannot validate many aspects of conformance. The focus of this section is to highlight these aspects of SPL that cannot be machine validated - particularly those aspects related to the SPL human readability requirements.</p><p>Description of Application Roles moved to the main specification.  The following responsibilities have been condensed leaving the actual requirements and not mentioning optional steps which were not required. Also those requirements which are simply restating some constraints that are documented in the HD and XML Schema are not repeated.</p><p>Recipient responsibilities</p><list role="unordered"><item><emph role="strong">Assume default values where they are defined in this specification, and where the instance does not contain a value:</emph> Where SPL defines default values, the recipient must assume these values in the event that no value is contained in an SPL instance. This holds regardless of whether or not the SPL Schema supplies the recipient with the default values. This receiver responsibility notwithstanding, it is recommended that originators not rely on default assumptions but instead place all relevant data explicitly into the document. In no way are originators encouraged to "compress" their documents by systematically removing information that is the same as the implied defaults.</item><item><emph role="strong">Parse and interpret the SPL content sufficiently to be able to render it:</emph> A recipient of an SPL document must be able to parse and interpret the SPL document sufficiently to be able to render it, using the following rendering rules:</item><item>The NonXMLBody, will need to be rendered with a software tool that recognizes its particular MIME media type. <emph role="strong">Since there can be no guarantee that a recipient can render every possible MIME type, a NonXMLBody may be ignored by a recipient.

Formerly it was discussed as 'requirements' and split over two parts of the specification. A discussion of requirements can not be actionable normative content. But the material is suitable as a scope statement, providing a summary of data covered by SPL.</p><div4 id=""><head>Scope of Document and Section Structures</head><p>Product labeling documents should be both human readable and machine processable.</p><p>Precise requirements regarding metadata for document management have not been established. Therefore, the model contains information that would be required regardless of document management processes (e.g., document identifier [id]) as well as information that may be desired in some realms (e.g., author, legal authenticator).</p><p>Product labeling documents may be revised or replaced. One document may be a transformation from another.</p><p>Formatting of documents may vary from one realm to another or one implementation to another.</p><p>HL7 structured documents contain sections. Product labeling documents tend to be organized into commonly understood sections (e.g., indications, precautions). While there may be a standard set of section names and hierarchies for a product labeling document in a given realm, at this time there is no single international standard product labeling document structure. Product labeling document content and structure is usually specified in regulations. Therefore, the SPL model is deliberately flat and non-hierarchical  the ability to identify and name sections has been provided, but the exact names, order, and nesting of sections are not specified. This provides a high level of flexibility in the model.</p><p>Product labeling document sections may be revised or replaced on a modular basis.</p><p>Sections contain narrative text.</p><p>Sections may contain data elements. Sections may also contain images (e.g., the chemical structure of a drug).</p></div4></div3></div2><storydivn identifier="sbs-PORP_DO000001UV-StructuredProductLabelDocument" name="Storyboards" parent="PORP_DO000001UV-StructuredProductLabelDocument-ic" id="sbs-PORP_DO000001UV-StructuredProductLabelDocument-ic"><descriptive identifier="sstop-PORP_DO000001UV-StructuredProductLabelDocument" name="Reference" parent="PORP_DO000001UV-StructuredProductLabelDocument-ic" id="sstop-PORP_DO000001UV-StructuredProductLabelDocument-ic"><p>For details on the interpretation of this section, see <xspecref spec="v3guide.htm" ref="v3gstory" alt="the storyboard discussion"/> in the Version 3 Guide.</p></descriptive><story identifier="PORP_ST050001UV01" name="Structured Product Label Document" familiarName="Publishing a Product Label" parent="PORP_DO000001UV-StructuredProductLabelDocument-ic" id="PORP_ST050001UV01-str" sortPrefix="80|" baseClass="StructuredProductLabelDocument" ballotStatus="DSTU" ballotNumber="5" lastEdit="2008-03-05T15:23:31" class="inserted"><descriptive identifier="purp-PORP_ST050001UV01" name="Purpose" parent="PORP_ST050001UV01-str" id="purp-PORP_ST050001UV01-str" role="purpose" lastEdit="2008-03-05T15:23:31"><p>ACME Pharmaceuticals Inc. is required by an the Panasian Medicines Agency (PMA) to create a product information document before the product can be marketed in that region.
