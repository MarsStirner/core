The model initially focused on the needs of the US Federal Government for HL7 messaging in the areas of disease surveillance and the reporting of adverse events, reactions or problems related to regulated products, as well as reporting by parties investigating incidents of public concern.  However, the model is not limited to US based reporting, or to regulatory application - but has been generalized to be applicable across the HL7 community.</p><p>The conditions or events that may be subject to review or investigation (i.e., the events that may trigger an investigation) are represented by the InvestigatedEventPackage class.  These events that cause the investigation can be represented at any level of granularity (individual observations, cases, incidents, outbreaks, etc.), allowing specifications to be written with specificity appropriate to the target environment.  In addition, triggering events can be disaggregated into more granular component events using the recursive component relationship.  Subjects, assessment of relatedness to known interventions, outcomes, locations, reporters and any special qualifiers can be represented for each triggering event, and for each of its components.</p><p>The Intervention section of the model captures information about any interventions (procedures or substance administrations potentially applied to the subject of a triggering event) that might be implicated as causing or affecting the triggering events.  The actual substances or devices involved in the interventions are described in the Product section of the model.  Alternatively, these products may be investigated directly, absent an intervention in a subject, and so they are associated directly with the investigation as well.  Other clinical information about the subjects of triggering events, or about individuals significantly related to these subjects, can be reported using the ClinicalStatement section of the model.  Clinical information surrounding the interventions themselves can also be represented using this section.</p><p>The investigative process is represented in the InvestigationEvent class.  Related to this class are known sources of information for the investigation, including identified reporters, related reports, and related documents (e.g. literature citations, primary source documents such as actual lab reports, discharge summaries, etc.).  Information that is developed during the Investigation process, such as the assessment of overall seriousness, is also associated directly with the investigation.  </p><p>It is important to understand that when this model is used to develop a reporting or notification specification, some particulars of such a  report, e.g., report id, date/time of transmission, party transmitting the  report, will  not be represented by any of the elements of this model.  They will, instead, be represented through the "trigger event" act contained in the "wrapper" model that preceeds the "payload" or report contents when the message is transmitted.  It is the payload only that is derived from this DMIM</p><p>The reader should note that this DMIM may be subject to major revision in order to be harmonized with the RCRIM TC DMIM. </p></descriptive><diagref ref="PORR_DM100001UV.gif"/></dmim></dmimdivn><subdivn identifier="PORR_DO000001UV-Individualcasesafetyreport" name="Individual Case Safety Reporting Topic" familiarName="Individual Case Safety Reporting" parent="PORR_DO000001UV-ic" id="PORR_DO000001UV-Individualcasesafetyreport-ic" role="BC" sortPrefix="50" baseClass="Individual Case Safety Reporting" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard" ballotNumber="1"><descriptive identifier="intro-PORR_DO000001UV-Individualcasesafetyreport" name="Introduction" parent="PORR_DO000001UV-Individualcasesafetyreport-ic" id="intro-PORR_DO000001UV-Individualcasesafetyreport-ic" lastEdit="2011-06-10T15:50:57"><emph> The standard HL7 introductory section has been enhanced with material relevant to the joint CEN, HL7, ISO ballot</emph><p><emph role="strong"> Foreword</emph></p><p>This standard is published as a SDO Joint Harmonization International Standard ISO 27953 and was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 215, Health Informatics, CEN TC 251 Health Informatics and HL7 Patient Safety Workgroup. </p><p> ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies).

Currently many regulatory agencies collect safety reports of adverse drug reactions, adverse events, infections, contamination and other incidents from consumers, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals. This standard consolidates content and messaging requirements based upon: 1) ISO New Work Item Proposal N545: Health Informatics - Pharmacovigilance - Structure and Data Elements of Individual Case Safety Report (reclassified as ISO 27953), 2) Health Level Seven (HL7) Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Release 1 Normative Standard, and 3) HL7 ICSR Release 2 Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU).</p><p>Readers should note that because of the significant differences in use cases and content requirements across these work items, this standard is published as a multi-part standard.  Part 1 of the standard (ISO 27953-1) has been specifically designed to address areas of overlap across the work items and form a messaging framework reference.  This framework can be applied to support data exchange requirements described in the many different use cases presented as storyboards in the standard.  This framework allows for future development work to be carried out so that additional use cases that are not addressed in this release can be added as new parts to this standard in the future.</p><p>International vocabulary harmonization for ISO 27953-1 is out of scope for this release and implementers may use existing vocabularies that are unique to their reporting requirements within their organization or region.  However, it is recommended that implementers create and publish their implementation guides to help inform and assist other implementers in applying the standard to other use cases and encourage terminology harmonization across SDOs.  The sponsoring committees may address vocabulary harmonization in subsequent releases of this standard.  Finally, this release of the standard is to establish a common, international messaging framework and should be used to facilitate future SDO harmonization efforts for other product reporting profiles for animal drugs, medical devices, combination products and food safety.</p><p>Part 2 of this standard (ISO 27953-2) has been created as a conformance profile to support human pharmaceutical reporting to global regulatory authorities and is based upon the International Conference on Harmonisation's (ICH) Revised Guideline E2B(R3): Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (version 3.96), November 2008. However, these initial requirements have been extended to take into account additional non-ICH requirements. Conformance for this part of the standard is dependent upon the related ISO vocabulary harmonization work items: Data Elements and Structures for the Exchange of Regulated Product Information for Drug Dictionaries (see ISO 11615, 11616, 11238, 11239 and 11240) and Structures and Controlled Vocabularies for Laboratory Test Units for the Reporting of Laboratory Results (see ISO 11595).</p><p><emph role="strong">Ballot Considerations</emph></p><p>This draft standard document is harmonized between ISO, CEN and HL7.  It is jointly balloted in all three organizations. In ISO/TC 215 and CEN/TC 251, this is currently a Draft International Standard (DIS).  Readers will notice that this document is formatted differently from other HL7 V3 specifications because of the need for consistency with ISO/TC 215 and CEN/TC 251 publications. Ballot reviewers should focus on the content and not submit comments related to the publication format.   Ballot comments should be submitted in accordance with the appropriate SDO ballot governing rules, i.e., through ISO National Member Body (NMB) representative, CEN National Member Body (NMB) representative, or through appropriate HL7 membership voting.  To help reduce duplication or conflicts in ballot responses among SDOs, HL7 International Affiliates are encouraged to coordinate with their ISO/CEN NMB representatives for submitting comments to this document. The sponsoring ISO, CEN and HL7 committees will jointly consolidate and reconcile all comments per ISO/CEN Vienna Agreement and the ISO/HL7 pilot agreement requirements.</p><emph role="strong">HL7 Version 3 Contents</emph><p>The format of the document follows the publication standards used by ISO and the standard publishing format for HL7 Version 3 (V3) standards.  This hybrid format makes it possible to present the ICSR Refined Message Information Models (RMIMs) and schema files in a seamless way, and to produce material that can be consistently balloted in the CEN, ISO, and HL7 environments.  It should be noted that the content for HL7 V3 Messaging Infrastructure (Transmission and Control Act) are included as separate annexes for this ballot to demonstrate support for ISO requirements related to message attachments, batch submissions and acknowledgements.  Note that this material is provided as reference only and is not subject to changes or comment as part of the ICSR ballot.  Any comments received for this content will be forwarded to HL7 for future consideration.</p><emph role="strong">SDO Harmonization</emph><p>The Joint Initiative on SDO Global Health Informatics Standardization has been formed to enable common, timely health informatics standards by addressing and resolving issues of gaps, overlaps, and counterproductive standardization efforts.  The Joint Initiative Charter provides the basis, purpose and structure of the Joint Initiative on SDO Global Health Informatics Standardization. The Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Standard was approved as a Joint Initiative project February 2008. The ICSR standard is a candidate for SDO harmonization because of the global interest to improve patient safety by the electronic exchange of high quality, unambiguous, structured data that will support regulatory and patient safety requirements and efficient safety signal detection for patient protection.  This standard is generally referred to as the ICSR.
</p><p>The standard's message specification is based upon the current release of HL7's Reference Information Model, including its Release 1 data types.  The sponsoring committees are aware of the current Joint Initiative Project, ISO/FDIS 21090 Health Informatics -- Harmonized Data Types for Information Interchange
(commonly referred in HL7 as Release 2 Data Types.)  The standard will be updated in subsequent releases to incorporate use of the new data type specification once appropriate vendor tools are available to facilitate conversion for implementers.</p><emph role="strong">Annexes </emph><p>Annexes are provided to facilitate ISO/CEN review of the HL7 V3 content. Readers should note that this content is provided and fully accessible as part of HL7's normal ballotting process.  The annexes are provided as background reference material and are not subject to ballot comments.  Note that the annexes for the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM), Data Types, and Vocabulary specifications are also provided as annexes for Part 2 of this standard.  Within Part 1, this content is available via hyperlinks within the appropriate sections.</p><p>Annex A (Normative) HL7 Transmission Infrastructure: This annex provides information about HL7 V3 message headers, acknowledgements and attachments.</p><p>Annex B (Normative) HL7 Control Act Infrastructure Topic. This annex provides information about the HL7 V3 Control Act and its relationship to the ICSR message payload.</p><p>Annex C  (Informative)HL7 Version 3 Guide: This annex contains information about The HL7 Version 3 standard, and discusses the process by which specifications are developed.</p><p>Annex D (informative) HL7 Reference Information Model: This annex provides background on the reference model used for developing all HL7 V3 specifications.</p><p>Annex E  (informative) HL7 Data Type Specifications: This annex describes the data types used to implement attributes in the specifications.</p><p>Annex F (informative) HL7 Vocabulary Specifications: The annex describes the principals behind HL7 Version 3 vocabularies, and includes the concept domains, code systems and value sets defined by HL7.</p><p><emph role="strong">1 Scope: Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)</emph></p><p><emph role="strong">Part I Scope</emph></p><p>Part 1 of this standard seeks to establish an international framework for data exchange and information sharing by providing a common messaging format for transmission of ICSRs for adverse drug reactions (ADR), adverse events (AE), product problems and consumer complaints that may occur upon the administration or use of one or more products.  The messaging format is based upon the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) and can be extended or constrained to accommodate a variety of reporting use cases described in the storyboard section of this ballot.  It should be noted that Part 1 will be harmonized over time with other HL7 public health and patient safety reporting standards to help insure messaging constructs and vocabulary are harmonized in the HL7 Public Heath and Regulatory Reporting domains.  Furthermore, Part 1 of this standard does not govern or dictate reporting requirements for any product.  However, the regulatory use cases (storyboards) described in this standard were derived from a variety of data sources including draft and final versions of internationally harmonized guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation, the International Cooperation on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH) GL 42, and the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) Study Group 2 N87 guideline.  The storyboards are for demonstration purposes only and help demonstrate the standard's scalability and interoperability across multiple stakeholders and product types. Future releases of this standard may be developed to include conformance profiles (templates) and vocabulary for all or a limited subset of the use cases.</p><p>Note that the data elements used in Part 1 were identified as consistent across many of the use cases and can be applied to a variety of  reporting scenarios.  Specific reporting requirements within organizations or regions may vary and the standard does not specify a vocabulary subset for these data elements in this release.</p><emph role="strong">2 Normative references</emph><p>The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

The committee received no negative comments or feedback about this decision, and all ICSR Release 1 content was carried over and harmonized with ICSR Release 2 DSTU.

GIN will be retained in the publishing domain as a separate topic and Safety Reporting will be removed to eliminate redundancy with the ICSR Topic.</p><p><emph role="strong">ICSR Part 1 Data Elements</emph></p><p>The data elements and concepts presented in Part 1 of this standard reflect the areas of overlap between ISO and HL7.  In the previous release of this standard, these data elements were referenced in support of "Generic Transmission Use Cases".  However, the concept of a generic transmission use case is not an SDO harmonized concept and is confusing for reviewers.  Therefore this concept is removed from this publication.  However, the sponsoring committees identified a core set of common data elements that are consistent across all use cases.  Due to significant differences in national and international requirements that govern the release and exchange of safety data, this standard does not enforce adoption of these data elements.  Note that the standard supports both coded attributes and free text entries for many of the data elements and readers should use the hyperlinks to the Hierarchical Message Definition (HMD) files to view detailed information about the attribute level descriptions for all data elements</p><p><emph role="strong">ICSR Basic Pattern</emph></p><p>The diagram below provides a high level summary of the core class components of the ICSR.  It is desirable that each ICSR have a minimum data set in order to process and evaluate the report:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Identifiable patient  (Note that this may be restricted by regulation and can be masked using "Privacy" or initials.  However, for product problems there may or may not be an identifiable patient.)</item><item>Identifiable reporter</item><item>Date of Event</item><item>Description of the event or problem</item><item>Product name</item></list><p><diagref ref="2009.12.20ICSRPattern.gif"></diagref></p><p> The following points should be noted:</p><list role="unordered"><item><emph>AE Reporting:</emph>  The information collected during the evaluation of an adverse event is modeled as an investigation into one or more reactions (adverse events) suffered by one or more persons or animals (investigated entity) after using an implicated product.  Note that product problem reports are treated similarly but there may or may not be an associated adverse event or reaction suffered by an investigated entity.</item><item>An important component of the information collected and transmitted to concerned parties includes relevant details about the primary source report for the event.  This information is capured in the class labeled "Report".  An investigation can lead to the submission of multiple reports.  Follow up (revised) reports may contain updated information such as laboratory results, indicate that the report was sent in error and should be retracted (usually referred to as a nullifcation), or may simply include the submission of a supporting document such as an autopsy report.</item><item>When it is necessary to collect information about other parties who are directly involved or have another association with the event, e.g., the mother in cases where a nursing infant is harmed, or siblings in vaccine related events, the relevant data is captured within the related entity construct.</item><item>The construct, "Product Reporting Relevant Information", supports information about the adverse event itself (commonly referred to as a reaction), information about the use of products that may be related to the adverse event, as well as relevant background information, (e.g., medical and medications history) for the investigated entity or for a related entity.  In the specification this construct is defined as a model in its own right.  The structure of this model is based on HL7's Clinical Statement Model and the committee is working with the appropriate HL7 workgroups (Orders and Observations, Pharmacy, Regulated Clinical Information Management, and Structured Documents) to harmonize requirements.  Over time this model construct will be updated and replaced with the harmonized content model or appropriate CMET.</item><item>The ICSR Product Model captures information about products used by the patient or an associated entity. This includes products that are implicated or considered suspects (primary) that may have an association with the adverse event. It also includes products that are used around the same time (usually referred to as concomitant or interacting products). This model captures information about associated product acts such as production, testing, supply, and distribution, as well as information about the product itself e.g., dosage form, ingredients, lot number, etc.  In a product problem report, information about the product is related directly to the investigation; however, note that the linkage is not shown in this summary diagram.   
		<p>Readers should note that this model is actually a CMET (R_ProductReportable COCT_RM630000UV) derived from the Common Product Model (CPM). This CMET may adjust over time as updates are made to the CPM. The ISO and HL7 committees will continue work to harmonize requirements for the ISO Identification of Medicinal Products work items.  The data elements reflected in this release of CPM DSTU Release 1 support the current pharmacovigilance requirements of ISO 27953-1 and ISO 27953-2.  Readers should note that ISO 27953 will use the most current version of CPM in its final international standard publication set for early 2011.  Navigation to the CMET content is through the ICSR base model Investigation Component Choice box and the consumable, product, and device participations in the A_ProductReportingRelatedInformation CMET.</p></item><item>The Causality class captures the methods, results and conclusions drawn by other parties involved in the investigation of the event.  This assessment conveys a belief about whether or not the use (administration, procedure or exposure) of a particular product is the cause of an adverse event or reaction.  Since information about adverse events and product use is captured in the Product Reporting Related Information construct, the model contains pointers to identify the specific adverse event and product use pair associated with each causality assessment statement.</item></list><p><emph role="strong">High Level Description of the ICSR Content</emph></p><p>The ICSR is comprised of two models defined directly in the PORR (public health reporting domain) and two CMETs:</p><list role="unordered"><item><emph>ICSR Base Model:</emph> This model captures information about the investigation, related investigations and primary source reports, ICSR senders, receivers, reporters, investigative subjects, associated persons, subject reactions and medical history.  Note that the base model includes act references or pointers to each associated model and CMET.    For detailed information about this model refer to the ICSR Refined Message Information Model (PORR_RM049006UV01).</item><item><emph>Product Reporting Related Related Information Model:</emph> This model is based on the broader Clinical Statement Model.  It includes the relevant clinical, product use and product defect discovery act information needed to support the various use cases supported by the standard. For detailed information about this model refer to the ICSR Related Information Model (PORR_RM0490013UV01).</item><item><emph>A_ClinicalResearchEnrollment CMET: </emph>This CMET model is used to capture information about the clinical trial that the investigative subject is enrolled in.  The HL7 committee expects to continue harmonization with the HL7 Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Workgroup on clinical trial messaging and will update this CMET upon completion of the CDISC HL7 Messages Project.  For detailed information about this model refer to the A_ClinicalResearchEnrollmentEvent CMET (COCT_RM970000UV) within the Common Message Element Types Domain.</item><item><emph>R_ProductReportable CMET:</emph> This CMET model is derived from the HL7 Common Product Model Release 1 Draft Standard for Trial Use and is used to capture information about a product referenced in the investigation.  Information about the product classification, product instance (lot ID, creation and expiration dates), packaging, product characteristics (intended use, size shape, color, etc.) and manufacturing are captured in this model.  Note that additional structure has been added to capture a variety of product-related acts, including production, distribution, chain of custody, testing, evaluation and disposition of contaminated products.  For detailed information about this model refer to the R_ProductReportable CMET (COCT_RM630000UV) within the Common Message Element Types Domain.</item></list><p><emph role="strong">ICSR and the Act State Machine</emph></p><p>The focal class for the ICSR Refined Message Information Model (RMIM) is InvestigationEvent.  Messaging related to the reporting of adverse events, product problems or consumer complaints is directly associated with the notification, initiation and/or progress of an investigation into an event.  The diagram below provides a summary view of the states and state transitions that are relevant to the ICSR.</p><p><diagref ref="ICSR_StateV0.1.gif"></diagref></p><p> Note that the the dynamic behavior being modeled is quite simple.  Messaging takes place when the discovery of an event or new information is "complete", and the reporter or sender determines that it is necessary to report to a receiving party (e.g., regulatory authority, manufacturer, public health or patient safety organization.)  The decision to report may be based upon specific business processes, regulations or statutory requirements, and the process for information flow is repeated when there is a need to revise or retract a previous report.

Dr. Provider prescribed a course of Ciprofloxacin 250mg tablets to be orally taken twice a day for 5 days. Mrs. Patient's only other regular medication is hormone replacement therapy, for which she takes Prempak C 625micrograms.  </p><p>After three days, Mrs. Patient's UTI is resolving well, but she is experiencing increasing soreness of her left ankle. She has no recollection of injuring her ankle in any way. On the fourth day, her ankle is so sore that she makes another appointment to see Dr. Provider later that day. Dr. Provider examines Mrs. Patient and observes that her left ankle is red, stiff, hot and swollen. Mindful of Mrs. Patient's comments that she has no recollection of doing anything that might have injured her ankle, Dr. Provider wonders what other causes there might be for these symptoms. Remembering that she prescribed an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection on Monday for Mrs. Patient, she checks her clinical software for Mrs. Patient's medication record and sees the prescription for Ciprofloxacin. She then checks the electronic drug formulary for information on Ciprofloxacin and Quinolone antibiotics as a family, and it reminds her that Quinolones are known to have an adverse effect of tendonitis, especially of the Achilles tendon. The formulary advises that the medicine should be stopped immediately and the affected joint rested. </p><p>Dr. Provider's clinical judgment leads her to be confident that Mrs. Patient is experiencing an adverse drug reaction to her treatment for her UTI. She explains this to Mrs. Patient, and that she must stop the Ciprofloxacin (she feels that the UTI has resolved well), and rest her ankle, and that the ankle soreness will resolve. She may take some painkiller medication (paracetamol/acetaminophen) if she would like to. However, she would like to see her again in a week just to be sure all is well. One week later, Mrs. Patient sees Dr. Patient again. Her ankle is improving nicely and she feels that in a couple of days she will be back to normal. After she has left, Dr. Provider thinks through this incident, and decides that, due to the severity of the event she should report it to a patient safety/quality improvement organization, the relevant drug manufacturer, and regulatory authority. She logs into her clinical support system to complete an electronic Individual Case Safety Report form.  The electronic form already includes many of the details of Mrs. Patient's adverse drug event. The form appears on the screen, with some of her relevant information already filled in e.g., Mrs. Patient's demographic information, relevant medical history, lab tests and results and current medications.  The form includes Dr. Provider's progress notes and other sections ready for her input. When Dr. Provider is satisfied that the form is complete, she then authorizes her clinical support system to send the electronic report to the appropriate organization(s). </p><p>Interaction: Individual Case Safety Report Create(<artref ref="PORR_IN049006" alt="PORR_IN049006"></artref>)</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORR_SN040002UV01" name="Individualcasesafetyreport 02" familiarName="ICSR Product Defect Reporting" parent="PORR_ST040001UV01-str" id="PORR_ST040001UV01-PORR_SN040002UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="50|" baseClass="Individualcasesafetyreport" lastEdit="2010-03-02T13:12:43" class="changed"><p><emph role="strong">Product Problem Reporting</emph></p><p>This storyboard is provided to help illustrate how the ICSR can be used for product problem reporting.

The anesthesiologist was unable to troubleshoot the cause of the device failure, nor restore its function.  The patient was informed of the device failure and opted to return to the O.R. the next day for the removal of the defective device and placement of a new pain pump.  The patient was scheduled to return to the O. R. for the repeated procedure.  The second Model LS 4700 implantable pain pump was implanted and completed its programming process without difficulty.</p><p><emph role="strong">Creation of the Initial Primary Source Report</emph></p><p>Dr. Sleeper decided to complete an electronic Individual Case Safety Report, using the hospital's Incident Reporting System because he felt his patient had suffered a serious injury.  She logged into the incident reporting system and completed the necessary fields required to populate a device adverse event.  The form appeared on the computer screen with a great deal of Ms. Everywoman's patient demographics, medical history and many details of her surgical case already populated because the incident reporting system references data already stored in the patient's  electronic medical record.  The event information was obtained from the surgeon's and the anesthesiologist's progress notes and automatically populated into the appropriate fields in the form.  Once the report of the incident was completed, Dr. Sleeper clicked the submit key.  This sent the incident report to the risk manager, Patient Safety Committee, the device manufacturer and the regulatory authority.  Mr. Randy Riskers, the hospital risk manager,  reviewed the incident report, made some edits and gave approval that this was a reportable event that could be sent to FDA.  He clicked a 'Submit SMDA Event' button that electronically forwarded the ICSR report to the manufacturer.  Additionally, the hospital returned the pain pump to the manufacturer for evaluation three days after the event.  </p><p>Interaction: Individual Case Safety Report Create  (<artref ref="PORR_IN049006UV" alt="PORR_IN049006UV"></artref>)</p><p><emph role="strong">Manufacturer Response to Reported Event</emph> - Note that this demonstrates how the Related Report class is used in the ICSR</p><p>Two weeks after the implantable pain pump was returned to Portman Medical for failure analysis, the manufacturer sent an update for the ICSR to the hospital and to the FDA.

This follow up serves to respond to CDRH's request for additional information about the software issue described in a report involving a Portman Medical Corporation, Model LS 4700 implantable pain pump implanted on December 12, 2005.  The Center requested information as to the software issue described as part of the root cause analysis of the implanted pain pump's failure.  The responses to the issues posed are as follows:  The software issue described in this report was a result of an event that would take place only in the rare instances of high resistance of the motor, causing an excessive back EMF (Electromotive Force).  This would ultimately lead to an inadvertent timeout of the internal watchdog times of the microprocessor, causing the pump to turn off prematurely.  A revision to the software of the Model LS 4700 implantable pain pump has completed Portman's Engineering Design Change Process.  Additionally, testing has been conducted on the software revision and no further instances of this failure have been detected.  It is felt no further risk can be associated with this release of the software.  Once approved, new pumps being built will contain the new software revision.  FDA stores all of the information related to this event and completes appropriate review of the event.</p><p>Interaction: Individual Case Safety Report Revise (<artref ref="PORR_IN049007UV" alt="PORR_IN049007UV"></artref>)</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORR_SN040008UV01" name="Individualcasesafetyreport 08" familiarName="Adulterated Food Reporting" parent="PORR_ST040001UV01-str" id="PORR_ST040001UV01-PORR_SN040008UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="50|" baseClass="Individualcasesafetyreport" lastEdit="2010-11-16T17:30:20"><p><emph role="strong">FDA Reportable Food Registry Reporting</emph></p><p>Great Cracker Company's Plant in St Cloud, MN produces two box sizes of Great Crackers--a 12 ounce box and a family-size 18 ounce box.

When the paramedics arrived, Mrs. Nuclear was still unconscious and she was taken to the hospital.  When she arrived at the hospital, Mrs. Nuclear regained consciousness in the examination room, and the emergency room attending physician, Dr. Attend ordered a series of tests to be performed to obtain a more precise diagnosis of Mrs. Nuclear condition.

Dr. Attend responded to Mr. Nuclear that he does not suspect this to be the case, but informs Mr. Nuclear that he can report the incident to the dietary supplement company or FDA to help alleviate his suspicion.  Mr. Nuclear called the FDA's Consumer Complaint hotline to report the problem, and provided a contact number for Dr. Attend for follow up once the laboratory results are final.

These include: </p><list role="ordered"><item>A report about an investigation into an adverse event(s) or reaction(s) suffered by a person or animal that experienced an intervention (substance administration or procedure) within a therapeutic context. The suspect event may or may not have a causal relationship with the intervention and the model supports events suffered by associated persons or animals, e.g., mother/child or siblings.</item><item>A report about an investigation into a product problem. The product problem may or may not include associated adverse events.  Note that the key common factor is the involvement of a suspect product such as a medication (human and animal drugs, biologics, vaccines), medical devices, food, dietary supplements or cosmetics. </item></list><p>The RMIM is oriented around the following concepts: </p><list role="ordered"><item><emph role="strong">Investigation:</emph> Information concerning the activity carried out to investigate and understand the adverse event or product problem.  This is the focal class for the model.  Note that participants (e.g., reporters, senders and receivers) in the investigation, as well as documents and/or observations related to the investigation may be recorded.</item><item><emph role="strong">Control Act:</emph> Information concerning the reporting of the investigation and/or related investigations (reports) for which information may be included.  Note that information for the author and/or primary recipient of the report may be included in this structure</item><item><emph role="strong">Adverse Event/Product Defect Assessement:</emph> An ICSR report is based on the assessment that either an adverse event or a product problem has occurred.  In some cases both adverse events and product problems are reported in the same investigation.  The assessment is linked to the person or animal subject of the adverse event or to the suspect product (in the case of a product defect).  The investigation may or may not be linked to causality assessments.  Note that the model supports additional observations related to the assessment, e.g., seriousness, severity or toxicity ratings for adverse events.</item><item><emph role="strong">Causality Assessment:</emph> Judgements concerning the cause or causes of an adverse event or product defect.  Includes the authors, methods, results and conclusions</item><item><emph role="strong">Primary Role/Investigation Related Entity:</emph> For an adverse event assessment, the role code provides information about the specific role a person(s) or animal(s) plays, e.g., a patient or research study participant, which suffered the adverse event.  Note that relevant information about the person and the event is captured in the related A_Product Reporting Relevant Information CMET.  In addition, if the person or animal is enrolled in a clinical trial, the trial can be identified as well. </item><item><emph role="strong">Study Enrollment:</emph> Relevant information about the clinical trial or study that the subject may be involved in.  Currently, the model supports the use of a choice box for recording information about the clinical trial using existing CMET A_ResearchStudyEnrollment (COCT_MT970000UV) or the constrained class attributes needed to identify the study information (note that this structure was introduced in support of Part 2 of this standard).</item><item><emph role="strong">Related Investigation:</emph> Information about other reports (primary source reports, prior submissions or secondary case transmissions) linked to the investigation.  This can include reports of the same adverse event based on investigations carried out by other parties, or reports of adverse events that are considered to be related, e.g., mother/child reports.</item><item><emph role="strong">Assigned Entity:</emph> Information for an entity, whether a person or organization that is involved in the reporting or assessment of the adverse event or product problem.

The information includes use of the product (substance administration and device procedures) and any associated clinical or laboratory information directly related to the product's use at a particular point in time, e.g., related to an adverse event, or as part of a subject's medical history.  The model also supports other patient care or healthcare related processes such as actions taken to mitigate or reduce harm.  A choice box structure is used (based upon HL7's A_SupportingClinicalInformation CMET) to capture the relevant information needed to evaluate the case.  It is expected that implementers will need to provide the appropriate code sets needed to distinguish between the various kinds of acts or observations used in the CMET.  Examples include Organizer codes to group medical or medications history, Observation codes for patient specific observations such as age and weight, and clinical diagnosis or conditions such as Diabetes.</p><p>The information model supports:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Drug administration, device procedure or other product exposure/use information: date, time, quantity, dose, and route of administration (or target site).  Note dosage form is captured as product information in the R_ProductReportable CMET (COCT_RM630000UV).</item><item>Component acts or concomitant therapies.</item><item>Authors and/or performers of healthcare acts or services.</item><item>Product defect discovery information.</item><item>Specimen collection and lab testing.</item><item>Organizer class to facilitate grouping of related acts

Currently many regulatory agencies collect individual case safety reports of adverse events, infections and incidents from consumers, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals.  This standard consolidates content and messaging requirements based upon: 1) ISO New Work Item Proposal N545: Health Informatics - Pharmacovigilance - Structure and Data Elements of Individual Case Safety Report (reclassified as ISO 27953), 2) HL7 ICSR Release 1 Normative Standard, and 3) HL7 ICSR Release 2 Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU).  This release of the standard focuses on the areas of overlap that specifically address the content across the work items.  
      </p><p>Readers should note that because of the significant differences in use cases and content requirements across these work items, this standard is published as a multi-part standard.  Part 1 of the standard (ISO 27953-1) has been specifically designed to address areas of overlap across the work items and form a messaging framework reference.  This framework can be applied to support data exchange requirements described in the many different use cases presented as storyboards in the standard.  This framework allows for future development work to be carried out so that additional use cases that are not addressed in this release can be added as new parts to this standard in the future.</p><p>Part 2 of this standard (ISO 27953-2) has been created for implementers interested in regulatory reporting for human pharmaceuticals, the initial work has been based upon the International Conference on Harmonisation's (ICH) Revised Guideline E2B(R3): Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (version 3.96), November 2008.  These initial requirements have been further extended to take into account additional international requirements.  This part of the standard is dependent upon the related ISO vocabulary harmonization work items: Data Elements and Structures for the Exchange of Regulated Product Information for Drug Dictionaries (see ISO 11615, 11616, 11238, 11239 and 11240) and Structures and Controlled Vocabularies for Laboratory Test Units for the Reporting of Laboratory Results (see ISO 11595).</p><p><emph role="strong">Ballot Considerations</emph></p><p>This draft standard document is harmonized between ISO, CEN and HL7.  It is jointly balloted in all three organizations. In ISO/TC 215 and CEN/TC 251, this is currently a Draft International Standard (DIS).  Readers will notice that this document is formatted differently from other HL7 V3 specifications because of the need for consistency with ISO/TC 215 and CEN/TC 251 publications. Ballot reviewers should focus on the content and not submit comments related to the publication format.   Ballot comments should be submitted in accordance with the appropriate SDO ballot governing rules, i.e., through ISO National Member Body (NMB) representative, CEN National Member Body (NMB) representative, or through appropriate HL7 membership voting.  To help reduce duplication or conflicts in ballot responses among SDOs, HL7 International Affiliates are encouraged to coordinate with their ISO/CEN NMB representatives for submitting comments to this document. The sponsoring ISO, CEN and HL7 committees will jointly consolidate and reconcile all comments per ISO/CEN Vienna Agreement and the ISO/HL7 pilot agreement requirements.</p><p><emph role="strong">HL7 Version 3 Contents</emph></p><p>The format of the document follows the publication standards used by ISO and the standard publishing format for HL7 Version 3 (V3) standards.  This hybrid format makes it possible to present the ICSR Refined Message Information Models (RMIMs) and schema files in a seamless way, and to produce material that can be consistently balloted in the CEN, ISO, and HL7 environments.  It should be noted that the content for HL7 V3 Messaging Infrastructure (Transmission and Control Act) are included as separate annexes for this ballot to demonstrate support for ISO requirements related to message attachments, batch submissions and acknowledgements.  Note that this material is provided as reference only and is not subject to changes or comment as part of the ICSR ballot.  Any comments received for this content will be forwarded to HL7 for future consideration.</p><p>Within the HL7 publications (which includes the Normative Editions of the standard as well as ballot packages),  ICSR material is found as a topic within the Public Health domain.  The content presented here includes the skeleton of that domain, with its other topics removed since they are not relevant to the ICSR.  We have endeavored to ensure that all hyperlinks are supported.  In addition, implementers should note the the standard message schemas will be found associated with interactions and hierarchical message descriptions in the Message Specifications section of this document.</p><p><emph role="strong">SDO Harmonization</emph></p><p>The Joint Initiative on SDO Global Health Informatics Standardization has been formed to enable common, timely health informatics standards by addressing and resolving issues of gaps, overlaps, and counterproductive standardization efforts.  The Joint Initiative Charter provides the basis, purpose and structure of the Joint Initiative on SDO Global Health Informatics Standardization. The Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Standard was approved as a Joint Initiative project February 2008. The ICSR standard is a candidate for SDO harmonization because of the global interest to improve patient safety by the electronic exchange of high quality, unambiguous, structured data that will support regulatory and patient safety requirements and efficient safety signal detection for patient protection.  This standard is generally referred to as the ICSR.</p><p>The standard's message specification is based upon the current release of HL7's Reference Information Model, including its data types.  The sponsoring committees are aware of the current Joint Initiative Project, ISO/FDIS 21090 Health Informatics -- Harmonized Data Types for Information Interchange (commonly referred in HL7 as Release 2 Data Types.), and the standard will be updated in future releases to incorporate these data types once appropriate technical tools are available to facilitate conversion.</p><p><emph role="strong">Annexes</emph></p><p> Annex A contains information on the HL7 Transmission Infrastructure.</p><p>Annex B contains information on the HL7 Control Act Infrastructure.</p><p>Annex C contains information on the HL7Version 3 Guide.</p><p>Annex  D contains information on the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM)

The standard provides a structure where reports can be exchanged in a clear and unambiguous manner such that the nature of the case, the circumstances in which it arose, and particularly the identity of the medicinal product(s) in question, can be communicated with certainty. Requirements for this use case were initially based upon ICH and conformance for Part 2 includes parallel adoption of ISO vocabulary work items: Data Elements and Structures for the Exchange of Regulated Product Information for Drug Dictionaries (See prEN ISO 11615, 11616, 11238, 11239, and 11240) and Structures and Controlled Vocabularies for Laboratory Test Units for the Reporting of Laboratory Results (See prEN ISO 11595). </p><p><emph role="strong">1.2 Topics outside ISO 27953-2</emph></p><p>This standard does not govern the reporting of ADRs or AE in animals, human exposure to products intended for veterinary use, safety reports related to blood transfusion, medical devices and combination products. Implementers of this standard should note that some combination products (refered to as Advanced Therapies in the EU) contain combinations of pharmaceuticals (which may in some instances be in the form of cells and tissues) along with medical devices or active implantable medical devices. In order to support regions that consider these products to be human pharmaceutical products, the message specifications for Part 2 of this standard (ISO 27953-2) uses an HL7 Common Message Element (CMET) derived from the HL7 Common Product Model to allow the capture of information for the medical device component. </p><p>This standard does not govern reporting for foods, dietary supplements, in-vitro diagnostics, homeopathic products, minerals, cosmetics, photo-therapy, radiotherapy and other therapies without products classified as medicinal products. For these use cases and any additional ones please refer to Part 1 of the standard (ISO 27953-1). Finally, some regions may elect to adopt a broader set of data elements based upon Part 1, especially related to clinical trial adverse event reporting. In these cases, implementers should refer to Part 1 to review the available data elements not covered in Part 2's scope.</p><emph role="strong">2 Normative references</emph><p>The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

The format for ICSR includes provisions for transmitting all the relevant data elements useful to assess an individual adverse drug reaction or adverse event report. The data elements are sufficiently comprehensive to cover complex reports from most sources, different data sets, and transmission situations or requirements; therefore, information for each and every data element will not be available for every transmission. In many, if not most instances, a substantial number of the data elements will not be known and therefore not included in the transmission. Where it was deemed important, provisions for unknown/not applicable were included (e.g., outcome, route of administration). However, since the transmission is intended to be electronic, it was thought to be unnecessary to include provisions to assign values of unknown for all data elements. Different ways of including the same data have been provided to cope with differing information contents: e.g., age information can be sent as date of birth and date of reaction/event, age at the time of reaction/event, or patient age group according to the available information. It is recommended that organizations develop and publish implementation guides that inform users of the standard on how these data elements should be used</p><p>Structured data are strongly recommended and provision for including structured information is supported in this standard. In certain instances, there are provisions for the transmission of some free text items, including a full text case summary narrative. Reference documents relating to the case being reported can be transmitted either within an ICSR message or as a separate message to the receivers. Handling of attachments to be sent as part of an ICSR message is supported using the Document attribute.  Attachments to be sent separately to the ICSR message are supported using HL7's Message Transmission Infrastructure Specification. </p><emph role="strong">Essential elements to be provided</emph><p>In most situations when generating an ICSR it is necessary to identify a patient, an adverse event/reaction, a reporter and a suspected medicinal product in order for the message to be considered valid.

In order to maintain the integrity of the HL7 model, additional elements are included: the structural attributes of the HL7 classes that contain the attributes that are mapped to the relevant human pharmaceutical reporting data elements, as well as the classes needed to navigate through the model structure.

The storyboards referenced in Part 2 were provided by the European Medicines Agency in support of ISO prEN ISO 27953.  The storyboards focus on international human pharmaceutical reporting and are based upon the International Conference on Harmonisation's reporting guideline: Revision of the ICH Guideline on Clinical Safety Data Management:  Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports E2B(R3) Version 3.96 13 November 2008.   Note that reporting for combination products is supported in Part 2 and these requirements are based upon criteria described in regional legislation in the EU and US.  EU reporting is governed by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products.  The amending Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 came into force on 30 December 2008 (http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2007_1394/reg_2007_1394_en.pdf).  In the US, reporting for combination products are under the purview of the FDA Office of Combination Products.  Readers should also note that while the standard does support these requirements, the standard does not dictate or enforce that ICSR be specifically used for these products.  It is expected that the EU and US regualtory authorities will issue separate guidance about the use of ICSR for these products at a later date and implementers should contact the appropriate regulatory authority prior to using ICSR for these products.

The suspect event may or may not have a causal relationship with the intervention and the model supports events suffered by associated persons e.g., mother/child or siblings.</p><p>The RMIM is oriented around the following concepts: </p><list role="ordered"><item><emph role="strong">Investigation:</emph> Information concerning the activity carried out to investigate and understand an adverse event.  This is the focal class for the model.  Note that participants (e.g., reporters, senders and receivers) in the investigation, as well as documents and/or observations related to the investigation may be recorded.</item><item><emph role="strong">Control Act:</emph> Information concerning the reporting of the investigation and/or related investigations (reports) for which information may be included.  Note that information for the author and/or primary recipient of the report may be included in this structure</item><item><emph role="strong">Adverse Event Assessment:</emph> An ICSR report is based on the assessment that an adverse event has occurred.  The assessment is linked to the person affected by an adverse event and to the suspect product that may have caused the event.  An investigation may or may not be linked to a causality assessment.  Note that the model supports additional observations related to the assessment, e.g., seriousness, severity or toxicity ratings for adverse events.</item><item><emph role="strong">Causality Assessment:</emph> Judgements concerning the cause or causes of an adverse event.  Includes the authors, methods, results and conclusions</item><item><emph role="strong">Primary Role/Investigation Related Entity:</emph> For an adverse event assessment, the role code provides information about the specific role a person plays, e.g., a patient or research study participant, which suffered the adverse event.  Note that relevant information about the person and the event is captured in the related Human Pharmaceuticals Product Reporting Relevant Information CMET.  In addition, if the person is enrolled in a clinical trial, the trial can be identified as well. </item><item><emph role="strong">Study Enrollment:</emph> Relevant information about the clinical trial or study that the subject may be involved in.  </item><item><emph role="strong">Related Investigation:</emph> Information about other reports (primary source reports, prior submissions or secondary case transmissions) linked to the investigation.  This can include reports of the same adverse event based on investigations carried out by other parties, or reports of adverse events that are considered to be related, e.g., mother/child reports.</item><item><emph role="strong">Assigned Entity:</emph> Information for an entity, whether a person or organization that is involved in the reporting or assessment of the adverse event or product problem.
		</item><item><emph role="strong">Product Information:</emph> Readers should note that product information is captured using a CMET (R_ProductReportable COCT_RM630000UV) derived from the Common Product Model (CPM). This CMET may adjust over time as updates are made to the CPM. The ISO and HL7 committees will continue work to harmonize requirements for the ISO Identification of Medicinal Products work items.  The data elements reflected in this release of CPM DSTU Release 1 support the current pharmacovigilance requirements of ISO 27953-1 and ISO 27953-2.  Readers should note that ISO 27953 will use the most current version of CPM in its final international standard publication set for early 2011.  Navigation to the CMET content is through the Human Pharmaceuticals base model Investigation Component Choice box and the consumable participation in the A_HumanPharmaceuticalsPRRI CMET.  The model captures information about products used by the patient or an associated entity. This includes products that are implicated or considered suspects (primary) that may have an association with the adverse event. It also includes products that are (delete or) used around the same time (usually referred to as concomitant or interacting products). This model captures information about associated product acts such as production, testing, supply, and distribution, as well as information about the product itself e.g., dosage form, ingredients, lot number, etc.

The information includes use of a product (substance administration and device procedures) and any associated clinical or laboratory information directly related to the product's use at a particular point in time, e.g., related to an adverse event, or as part of a subject's medical history.  The model also supports other patient care or healthcare-related processes such as actions taken to mitigate or reduce harm.  A choice box structure is used (based upon HL7's A_SupportingClinicalInformation CMET) to capture the relevant information needed to evaluate the case.  It is expected that implementers will need to provide the appropriate code sets needed to distinguish between the various kinds of acts or observations used in the CMET.  Conformance for Part 2 uses the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding and other codes provided by ICH.  Examples include Organizer codes to group medical or medications history, Observation codes for patient specific observations such as age and weight, and clinical diagnosis or conditions such as Diabetes.</p><p>The information model supports:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Drug administration and device procedure information: date, time, quantity, dose, and route of administration (or target site).  Note dose form is captured as product information in the R_ProductReportable CMET (COCT_RM630000UV).</item><item>Component acts or concomitant therapies.</item><item>Authors and/or performers of healthcare acts or services.</item><item>Specimen collection and lab testing.</item><item>Organizer class to facilitate grouping of related acts relevant to a point in time, e.g., vaccines given
